# Temporal-Series
Working with Temporal Series - Linear regression

Time Series are sets of data that are collected, recorded or observed at regular time intervals. Time Series modeling involves analyzing past patterns to make future predictions.

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical model widely used for Time Series forecasting. It combines autoregression (AR), moving average (MA), and differencing (I) components to capture temporal patterns in data.
